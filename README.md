Coloured dots demoing two clustering algorithms

Two algorithms implemented in Java:
* FLAME clustering
* Fuzzy C Means clustering

Both of them are demoed in graphical dots being coloured.

###Usage
* **Point and click** creates new dot on screen where you point.
* ```SPACE``` removes ALL dots. Unrecoverable.
* ```F``` runs FLAME clustering.
* ```C``` runs C means clustering.
* ```S``` opens setup dialog where you can change algorithm parameters.
* ```R``` resets parameters to their default values.
